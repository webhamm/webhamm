# Hi from Chris Hamm
*Quick blurb on me...* I am a passionate (*value creating, team leading) technology professional, interested in how to simplify, and streamline processes for businesses using technology. Focused on quality and always implementing lessons learned which supports my own personal continuous integration strategy in life. Working in various groups from research and development to a top [Internet Media company](https://www.cnet.com) visited by millions every day.

**Specialties:** Leadership in engineering & development, website development, technology architecture design, technology operations, security analysis, and website management.

In my free time, I like to play with technology to understand it better. Recent project(s) includes setting up a ML driven website regression tool, playing with Hubot and AI via Google AI, TensorFlow, and trying to find time for my personal site and support the technology stack of [SubscriptionBoxMom.com](https://www.subscriptionboxmom.com/).
